# RSGISLib #

The Remote Sensing and GIS software library (RSGISLib) is a collection of tools for processing remote sensing and GIS datasets.
For more details see the project website: http://rsgislib.org/

## Installing ##

Binaries of RSGISLib for Python 3.5 on Mac OS X and Linux are provided through [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html). After installing minconda, RSGISLib and the required pre-requisites can be installed using:

```
conda create -n rsgislib_env -c rios rsgislib
source activate rsgislib_env
```

If you need to use RSGISLib under Windows the easiest way to do so is through a virtual machine, for more details see [here](https://spectraldifferences.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/installing-rsgislib-on-windows-through-a-virtual-machine).

## Documentation and Support ##

The documentation for RSGISLib is available from the project website: http://rsgislib.org/

Support for RSGISLib is provided through a mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rsgislib-support
You need to be a member of the group to post.
Please check through existing posts to see if there is already an answer to your question before emailing.
To help us answer your question provide as much information as possible (RSGISLib version and how you installed it, OS, things you have already tried to solve the problem etc.,).

We occasionally post tutorials on RSGISLib to our [blog](https://spectraldifferences.wordpress.com/tag/rsgislib/).
